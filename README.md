## Overview

This Python-based web scraping project is designed to extract information from the website "fastpeoplesearch.com." The script includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that provides functionalities for controlling the scraping process, including pause, stop, and alert handling for CAPTCHA challenges.

- GUI for user interaction and control of the scraping process.
- Pause and resume functionality.
- Stop the scraping process.
- Alert notification and CAPTCHA handling.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.9
- Required Python libraries (selenium, chromedriver-autoinstaller, pyqt5, pandas)
- Web driver for browser automation ChromeDriver.
- CAPTCHA solving service and confirm to continue with the process extraction.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JorgeCastillo3004/web_scraping_find_phone_address.git
```

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download and configure the web driver for your browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox).

## Usage

1. Start the script by running `main.py`.

```bash
python main.py
```

2. The GUI will open, allowing you to enter search parameters and control the scraping process.

3. Use the GUI buttons to control the scraping process:
   - **Start**: Initiates the scraping process.
   - **Pause**: Pauses the scraping process.
   - **Stop**: Stops the scraping process.
   - **CAPTCHA Alert**: Notifies you when a CAPTCHA challenge is encountered, allowing you to solve it manually.
