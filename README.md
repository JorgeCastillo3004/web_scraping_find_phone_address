- Python 3.9
- Required Python libraries (selenium, chromedriver-autoinstaller, pyqt5, pandas)
- Web driver for browser automation ChromeDriver.
- CAPTCHA solving service and confirm to continue with the process extraction.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JorgeCastillo3004/web_scraping_find_phone_address.git
```

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download and configure the web driver for your browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox).

## Usage

1. Start the script by running `main.py`.

```bash
python main.py
```

2. The GUI will open, allowing you to enter search parameters and control the scraping process.
